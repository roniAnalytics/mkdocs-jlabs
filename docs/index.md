# Getting Started

Welcome to the official documentation for JLabs OEMS.  [jlabs.pandaterminal.com](https://jlabs.pandaterminal.com/).

## Setting up your account

API from external exchange(e.g. Bybit) will enable you to interact with our exchange remotely and it will provide real-time price and support direct execution of trade.

You need to have a registered account on such external exchange in order to start using JLabs Digital OEMS. For the most optimised OEMS experience, we encourage you to sign up under JLabs Digital affiliation for external exchanges.
